## 🎯 Why I'm Doing This

In the next 4 months, I want to achieve the following:
- Develop a strong foundation in Python programming  
- Build my problem-solving and algorithmic thinking  
- Learn key Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques  
- Complete real-world projects that align with industry needs  

Everything I learn, try, fail at, and eventually fix will be documented here! ✍️

## 📂 What’s in This Repo?

Here’s how I’m organizing my progress. Think of this as my learning library:

```
ML_DS-journey/
├── 01-Day/ # 
├── 02-Day/
├── ...
├── projects/ # Each folder is a major project or case study
├── notes/ # Explanations, math breakdowns, and summaries
└── references/ # Articles, tools, books, and extra resources
```

You’ll find **daily progress updates** in the `Day-xx` folders and larger builds in `projects/`.
